Pizza Sales Report Dashboard
1. Project Title
Pizza Sales Report Dashboard (Jun 2025 – Jun 2025)
An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze pizza sales performance across categories, sizes, and individual products—providing actionable insights into revenue, orders, and customer preferences.

2. Short Description / Purpose
The Pizza Sales Dashboard is built to help restaurants, analysts, and managers understand sales trends and performance across different categories, pizza sizes, and time periods. It highlights key revenue drivers, busiest order times, and best/worst-selling pizzas, supporting decision-making for marketing, operations, and inventory planning.

3. Tech Stack
   
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
📊 Power BI Desktop – Data visualization and dashboard creation.
📂 Power Query – Data cleaning, shaping, and transformation.
🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For calculated measures (revenue, averages, trends).
📝 Data Modeling – Relationships established among orders, sales, and product tables for cross-filtering.
📁 File Format – .pbix for development, .png for dashboard snapshots.

5. Data Source
Source: Pizza sales dataset (2025).
The dataset contains detailed order-level information, including order date, pizza category, pizza size, revenue, and quantity sold.

6. Features / Highlights
• Business Problem
The restaurant business often struggles to identify best-selling products, peak sales times, and categories driving the most revenue. Without clear insights, it is difficult to optimize menu offerings, marketing, and operations.

• Goal of the Dashboard
To provide a centralized visual tool that:
Identifies best & worst-selling pizzas.
Analyzes trends by time (daily, monthly).
Breaks down sales by pizza size and category.
Improves decision-making in sales strategy, pricing, and promotions.
